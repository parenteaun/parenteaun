## Description: 
Working on Project Euler Problems in Python to de*rust my coding skills

## Starting Ecosia Search Count: 585
## Ending Ecosia Search Count: 

## Narrative: 
* Logged into Ecosia for a more reliable search total. 
* Continued work on Problem 2
* Problem 2 complete. 
* Started Problem #3
* Reached out to Ecosia via twitter for troubleshooting as my search totals aren't incrementing.
* Follow-ups with ProjectDrawdown about contribution. 
* Installed Jupyter Notebook (never used this before previously)
