## Narrative: 
* Came up with an idea for an automation script that will create these narrative journals for me based on a template. Practical way to practice with file system manipulation in python. 
* Worked on Problem #4. Almost complete. Made first guess but it was incorrect. Need to do more debugging.
* Completed Problem #4. Had to traverse the factors backwards. Solution works well but is currently only coded for 3 digit factors. An additional function or two could expand this script out for numbers of any size.
