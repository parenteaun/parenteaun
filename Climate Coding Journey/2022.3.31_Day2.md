Narrative: 
- Reviewed a ton of open source projects on GitHub that interest me, topics ranging from Climate activism, nerdy endeavors etc. Starred a bunch for follow-up and issue discovery. 
- Python is pretty rusty since I haven't used it for any serious projects in over a year. Signed up for an account on Project Euler to practice problem solving.
- Created ProjectEulerPython practice repository
- Project Idea: Build a webscrapper to automate the download of all the project euler problems
- Solved Problem 1.
- Started Problem 2. I was able use code to create the Fibonacci sequence into a list. Rather than simply traverse this list with a loop to solve the problem, I decided to use the opportunity to load that list into a Pandas dataframe for the sake of practice. Tomorrow I will filter the dataframe to complete the problem.
